You find yourself on the frantic field of Milot, where over 570 years ago, the legendary Albanian leader Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu faced an overwhelming Ottoman force and achieved a stunning victory with sheer determination and tactical brilliance. Now, this very battleground is under siege again. The situation is critical, and every second matters. Defend these gates with all your strength and resolve-- just as Skenderbeu once did, you must hold your ground and fend off this threat!
