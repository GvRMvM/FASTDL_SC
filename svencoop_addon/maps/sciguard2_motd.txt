== SciGuard2 (Unfinished, Last Salvageable Build) ==
by Tuesday's Avenger

== Objective ==

- Defend the 5 scientists for 15 minutes. At least one scientist must survive.

== Notes / Tips ==

- The battlefield is broken into 3 major sectors - North, 
Central, and South - joined by teleport zones. 
You arrive in these teleporter zones from the spawn area. 

- Take the GREEN lit teleporter chambers to return to spawn.

- Enemies will attack from the tunnels leading to the 3 main arenas.

- Every few minutes a group of randomly selected High-Threat 
enemies will appear from a randomly selected tunnel. These foes will 
be much more dangerous and will likely require combined firepower to defeat.

- Return to the spawn area to grab weapons, ammo, and health. 
Beware, the delay in resupplying can be costly.

- HEV chargers are located in the North arena. Defend them!

- You have 3 mobile sentries at your disposal; 
they can be moved like a pushable by walking up to them, 
then pressing and holding the "use" key.

- Sentries can be repaired using the Wrench.

- Beware of sentry lines of fire - they can harm scientists, allied NPCs, 
and other turrets.

- Use the Medkit to heal injured scientists, other players, and allied NPCs.

- You are assisted by Leonard and Geoffrey, a pair of tame Vortigaunts. 
They are more powerful than the average Vort, and can be a powerful asset. 
However, be sure to keep them healed! If they go down and you do not 
revive them, they are lost permanently.

- Use the Medkit's revive feature to bring back fallen players; 
the time lost in respawning can cost you control of an area.

- Scientist counters are located in several areas, and will display 
how many of the science officers are alive (green) or dead (red).

- Scientists cannot be revived.
