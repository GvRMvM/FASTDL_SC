One of our ospreys has crashed in enemy territory, we have lost
all contact with the crew and are not sure if there are any
survivors left. the city is heavily defended and time is
critical. We have send two ospreys to the area to quickly locate
the crashed osprey and check for survivors. A number of APC's
is on their way to help out the rescue team. 


  Mission Objectives:

The enemy will be armed with a variety of weapons. Intelligence
tells us that these weapons include assault rifles, shotguns and
handguns. Reliable sources tell us that there will be snipers
around the city, don’t underestimate them. Furthermore, there
are some unconfirmed rumors that the enemy is armed with
flamethrowers.
