ns_escape

A mining and research outpost on a far away planet has gone into lockdown.
Aliens are on the loose and the quarantine self-destruction sequence has been initiated.
The only method of escape is a broken shuttle found in the hangar bay.


HOW TO PLAY

Players must find two batteries to open the hangar door in the main lobby.
Batteries can only be found in numbered rooms. 
Once inside the hangar the shuttle will require repairing.
The items required will also be in numbered rooms.

Rooms are locked and require one of three methods to open.

1. Find the keycard corresponding to that numbered room (number 5 keycard = number 5 door )
2. EVO suit that allows you access the vents found outside, which lead you to the rooms.
3. Find a toolbox, a one-time use item that opens any locked door.

Breakable crates will drop random gear, red crates will drop even better gear.
Each room has 2 red crates guaranteed.
