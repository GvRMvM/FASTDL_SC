****Map Briefing****

The UTO (United Terrorist Organizaion) is at it again since
your group hasn't seen any actoin yet we thought this be a good first 
one. The UTO is making a Robot Drone able to replace the man on the 
field . . . we want you to go in take any blueprints and destroy the
facillity. Good Luck

****Map Backround****

The UTO was started after the Soviet Union collapsed. They are said to
be lead by a man name General Warren Cisco an awal US general. Cisco is
belived to head up many terrorist actions to try to premote his cause, 
"Peace Through Power." Cisco's right-man man, named Kane is his most 
trusted friend and partner. Cisco has a long and respected past why he
started the UTO are unknown. It is believed Kane had something to do 
with it but no one really knows who this man is. Now at present times 
the UTO has be kidnapping many promenent reaserchers and using them to 
make weapons of mass distruction. Cisco is funding these projects 
through methods unknown.

You and your group members are part of a special commando squad called 
the Black Squadren. The Black Squadren have been hindering the UTO's 
efforts ever since they have been assembled. The Black Squadren is 
made up of about 20 groups of 8 elite special forces. Though in recent 
years since the introduction of Kane into the UTO the Black Squadren 
has been failing missiberaly. It is as if the UTO knows the future 
they are able to predict most of the our actions before they are even 
launched.
